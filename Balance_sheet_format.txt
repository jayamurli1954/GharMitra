## ✅ Accounting Checks (VERY IMPORTANT)

✔ **Assets = Liabilities**
✔ All **Funds are backed by bank FD / cash**
✔ No income or expense appears in Balance Sheet
✔ Member-wise dues shown under *Receivables*

---

## 🧠 How This Maps Perfectly into **GharMitra**

### 🔹 Funds → Liability Accounts

* Sinking Fund
* Repair Fund
* Major Repair Fund

(each must have **separate ledger + bank FD mapping**)

---

### 🔹 Member Dues

* Appear as **Maintenance Receivable**
* Member ledger total = Balance Sheet figure
  *(this is a MUST-check rule in your system)*

---

### 🔹 Cash & Bank

* Bank balances must match:

  * Savings account statement
  * FD balances (with maturity mapping)

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid (Important for Software Design)

❌ Showing income surplus directly as “Profit”
❌ Mixing fund balances with bank balances
❌ Allowing vouchers without fund tagging
❌ Trial balance matching but Balance Sheet wrong (dangerous)

---

## 🟢 Verdict (Founder + Auditor Safe)

> This format is **100% acceptable** to:

* Society auditors
* AGM presentation
* Registrar filings
* Bank loan / FD verification

This is the **exact structure GharMitra should auto-generate**.
