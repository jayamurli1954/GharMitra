### **Asset Register & Common Property Accounting**

**Project:** GharMitra – Housing Society ERP
**Module:** Finance, Compliance, Audit
**Priority:** **High**
**Type:** Legal & Accounting Compliance
**Submitted by:** Product Owner – SanMitra Tech
**Date:** 2026-01-11

---

## 1️⃣ Objective

To implement a **formal Asset Register** in GharMitra to record all **common area assets** handed over by the developer or acquired later by the society.

These assets include:

* Lifts
* DG sets
* Water systems
* Pumps
* Gym equipment
* Furniture
* Clubhouse
* Common lighting
* etc.

---

## 2️⃣ Business Problem

Most societies:

* Do not maintain a proper asset register
* Cannot prove ownership
* Cannot insure assets properly
* Cannot depreciate assets
* Fail during audits

This creates:

* Legal risk
* Financial misstatement
* Disputes with builders & insurers

---

## 3️⃣ Functional Requirements

### FR-1

System shall maintain an **Asset Master**.

### FR-2

Each asset shall have:

* Name
* Category
* Location
* Cost
* Date of handover
* Depreciation rate
* Status
* AMC vendor
* Insurance details

### FR-3

Assets handed over by developer shall be entered via **Opening Balance JV**.

### FR-4

Assets purchased later shall be created via **Payment Voucher + Asset Creation**.

### FR-5

System shall calculate **depreciation annually**.

---

## 4️⃣ Accounting Treatment

Assets shall appear in:

**Balance Sheet → Assets → Fixed Assets**

And offset by:

**Corpus Fund / Capital Contribution**

---

## 5️⃣ Reports Required

| Insurance Asset List        | Committee          |
| AMC Asset List              | Manager            |

---

## 6️⃣ Audit & Compliance

* Assets cannot be deleted
* Sale or scrapping requires approval
* All changes must be logged

---

### For Admin / Committee

```
Finance → Assets → Asset Register
