### **Owner & Tenant Move-In / Move-Out Governance System**

**Project:** GharMitra – Housing Society ERP
**Module:** Membership, Compliance, Finance
**Priority:** **Critical**
**Type:** Operational & Legal Compliance
**Submitted by:** Product Owner – SanMitra Tech
**Date:** 2026-01-12

---

## 1️⃣ Objective

To implement a **controlled, legally compliant workflow** for:

* Flat ownership transfer
* Tenant onboarding
* Vacating flats
* Handling pending dues
* Issuing No Dues Certificates

This prevents:

* Loss of society revenue
* Illegal transfers
* Legal disputes
* Audit failures

---

## 2️⃣ Problems Today

Most societies:

* Allow people to move in/out without clearing dues
* Lose track of tenants
* Face legal disputes during flat sale
* Cannot prove who was responsible for arrears

---

## 3️⃣ New Governance Model

GharMitra shall enforce:

> **“No Flat Transfer without Zero Dues.”**

And track:

* Who lived
* When
* Who owed
* Who paid

---

## 4️⃣ Moving-In Workflow

### Owner Move-In

1. Admin creates **New Owner Request**
2. Collect physical documents:

   * Sale Deed
   * ID proof
3. In GharMitra:

   * Mark documents “Verified”
   * Set ownership start date
4. System checks:

```
Old owner balance == 0
```

5. Only then:

```
Owner transfer allowed
```

---

### Tenant Move-In

1. Owner submits:

   * Tenant details
   * Rent agreement
   * Police verification
2. Admin marks:

   * Documents verified
3. Tenant status becomes:

```
ACTIVE
```

---

## 5️⃣ Moving-Out Workflow (for more clarity read Addendum below)

### Tenant Vacating

1. Tenant requests move-out
2. System calculates:

```
Final dues up to vacate date
```

3. Must be paid
4. Tenant status → INACTIVE

---

### Owner Selling / Leaving

1. Owner requests transfer
2. GharMitra generates:

```
No Dues Statement
```

3. Must be cleared
4. Society issues:

```
No Dues Certificate
```
## in case there is a Dispute regarding Dues of Moving-Out Owner or Tenant ##

5. New Concept: Personal Arrears Account

When an owner or tenant vacates with unpaid dues:

Outstanding dues must be transferred from the Flat Ledger to a Personal Arrears Ledger belonging to that person.

This allows:

Flat transfer to proceed

Society’s claim to remain enforceable

Ownership transfer enabled

---

## 6️⃣ Legal Rule

> ** Dues belong to the person and not to the flat.
> ** Flat may be transferred only after disputed dues are moved to Personal Arrears Ledger

---

## 7️⃣ Accounting Entry -Example (Mandatory) ##

If Flat A-203 has ₹18,750 due and Owner Ramesh is vacating:

Flat A-203 balance = 0
Ramesh Arrears = 18,750  due -> In Personal Arrears Ledger

## Flat can be transferred. ##

## 🧾 Waiver or Settlement Later ##

If ₹5,000 waived:

Bad Debt / Waiver    Dr 5,000
    Ramesh_Arrears   Cr       5,000   (In Personal Arrears Ledger)

If ₹13,750 paid:

Bank /Cash           Dr 13,750

# 🔁 **Settlement Workflow**

This gives legal trail.
