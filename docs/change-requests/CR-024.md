## **1. Change Summary**

### **Current Situation**

GharMitra currently provides dashboards and reports but lacks:

* Formal role-based financial visibility

* Structured Audit & Compliance dashboard
* Controlled exposure of financial data to members

This can cause:

* Privacy risks
* Legal exposure
* Disputes

---

### **Requested Change**

Implement a **Finance Governance Layer** in GharMitra that introduces:

1. **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
2. **Member-safe financial reporting**
3. **Committee-level finance console**
4. **Auditor-grade compliance dashboards**
5. **Enforced data access rules at API & UI level**

This will make GharMitra **legally compliant, audit-ready, and dispute-resistant**.
