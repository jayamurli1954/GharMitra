CHANGE REQUEST (CR)



CR ID: 6-01-07-021

Project: GharMitra – Housing Society ERP

Submitted By: Product Owner (SanMitra Tech Solutions)

Date Submitted: 2026-01-07

Priority: Critical

Type: Compliance / Data Integrity

Status: Submitted



#### 1\. CHANGE SUMMARY

Current Situation



GharMitra currently does not have a legally compliant and standardized monthly maintenance billing engine. Billing is not yet based on square-foot area, number of residents, or Indian society accounting norms.



#### Requested Change :



Implement a Monthly Maintenance Billing Engine that:  

Monthly maintenance Billing has different types each society has its way of calculating the maintenance billing so the maintenance Bling Engine has to be flexible and should have all the option so that committee will opt for the best suited option for them 



1. Calculates maintenance based on sq.ft × rate -> Admin input required.if not calculated based on area the rate should be '0'
   
2. Calculates on Per Person water charges + Calculates total Expenses for the Bill period (here admin input required as to which expenses to be included and which should excluded. Calculates water charges per resident -> Add Total water charges for the month of bill period that is total of  **5110 Water**

 **Charges - Tanker + 5120  Water Charges - Government  ÷ total inmates × per flat inmates Say total water charges = 30000  total inmates 60 then per person water charges = 30000 ÷ 60 =500 this per person water charges If Flat A-101 has 4 inmates/member then Flat A-101 water charges = 500 × 4 = 2000. Before arriving total inmates any addition or deduction of inmates /members  due additional guest or inmates going on long vacation  for more than 7 days to be adjusted. hence Admin input is required arriving total inmates.** Fixed expenses may applied equal per-flat charges or  based on area - If equal total expenses **÷ total no of flats  or if by area total expenses ÷ total area x flat area say if it is equal per flat. 25000 ÷ 20 = 1250 if by area 25000 ÷ 25000 = 1 x 1250 (area A-101) = 1250**


**3.** Calculates sinking fund per sq.ft or per flat as per Input



**4.** Calculates repair fund per flat or per sq. ft. as per Input



**5.** Calculates Corpus fund per flat or per sq. ft. as per Input



#### Accounting Rule :



After the bill is generated    4000  Maintenance Charges  to be credited  and   1100	Maintenance Dues Receivable to be debited  System has to check credit = debit no difference

system also has to post this bill amount to individual member against their Flat ID. This posting is required for knowing  and tracking individual flat ID dues and follow up for collection .

when payment made by the member,  1100	 Maintenance Dues Receivable to be credited  and  1001 HDFC Bank - Main Account or  1010  Cash in Hand as the case may be to be debited   there should also an entry in the Members Due register so this will reduce their balance.

Its a double entry accounting system debit = credit  if it is do not match no account posting should not carried out and a appropriate warning message to be displayed.

System should  ensue that  1100	 Maintenance Dues Receivable  is always matches members due register(Please note Members register is not part of Trial Balance or General ledger.

## special Note #$

"Account code should not be harcoded in any of the code base and should be dynamic selection because each society may habe different COA  list with different coding numbers"



Reason for Change



☐ Bug/Error correction

☐ Security vulnerability

☐ Performance issue

☑ Regulatory compliance

☑ Business requirement change

☐ Technology upgrade

☑ Data integrity issue



Without this engine, the society cannot legally or fairly collect maintenance.



Urgency Level



Critical — This is core functionality. Without it, the society cannot operate.



2\. IMPACT ANALYSIS

2.1 Business Impact

Negative Effects



Initial setup complexity



Requires correct master data (sq.ft, inmates)



Business Metrics Affected



Revenue impact: Enables 100% of society collections



Cost impact: Low



Productivity impact: Huge improvement for treasurer \& committee



2.2 Technical Impact



Systems Affected



☑ Frontend UI



☑ Backend API



☑ Database



☑ Reports



☑ Documentation



Dependencies



Flat master (sq.ft)



Inmates (headcount)



Billing rules



Monthly expenses



Performance Impact



Minor increase in computation during bill generation



No real-time performance risk



2.3 User Impact



Users Affected



All flat owners and tenants



Treasurer and committee



Workflow Changes

Payments link to bills



Dues auto-calculated



Training Required



Short onboarding for treasurer



Communication Plan

#### 3\. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS



3.1 Functional Changes



FC-1: Maintenance Calculation



Input: Flat sq.ft, maintenance rate



Process: sq.ft × rate



Output: Monthly maintenance



FC-2: Water Calculation



Input: Total water bill, inmate count



Process: Total ÷ total inmates × flat inmates



Output: Flat water charge



FC-3: Fixed Expenses

total of selective expenses ÷ total flat or ÷ total area  x individual flat



Repair fund = per flat or per sq. ft. as per Input

Sinking Fund =Sinking fund per sq.ft or per flat as per Input

Corpus fund= per flat or per sq. ft. as per Input





FC-4: Bill Generation



Create bill for every flat



Post ledger entries



Set due date



3.2 Non-Functional Changes



Performance



Bill generation for 50–500 flats must complete < 5 seconds



Security



Bills cannot be edited after posting but admin has the right reverse the entire bill and regenerate with proper notes /committee approval for reversal and regeneration.

Only committee can regenerate

Once a bill generated for a month again cannot be re generated if it is not reversed.



Usability



Members must see breakup clearly



Treasurer can export reports
