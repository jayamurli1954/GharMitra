Great — I have used **your uploaded CR template** and prepared a **fully-filled Change Request** for the new **“Expense For Month (Month-Tagged Cash Accounting)”** model in **GharMitra**.

Below is the CR in your exact structure.

# **CHANGE REQUEST (CR)**

*(Based on your uploaded CR Template )*

---

## **CR ID:** 

**Project:** GharMitra – Housing Society Accounting System
**Submitted By:** Muralidhar Rao (Product Owner)
**Date Submitted:** 08-Jan-2026
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Business Requirement Change
**Status:** Submitted

---

## **1. CHANGE SUMMARY**

### **Current Situation**

GharMitra currently expects expenses to be recorded against the actual transaction date.
If December expenses are paid in January, they get booked in January, causing:

* Wrong December maintenance bills
* Incorrect income & expense reports
* Mismatch between cash flow and billing

This creates problems especially for small housing societies where:

* Vendors are not maintained
* Accrual accounting is not followed
* Payments are mostly “cash and carry”

---

### **Requested Change**

Introduce a **mandatory “Expense For Month” field** in all expense and payment entries.

This will allow users to:

* Record when the expense was **paid**
* Specify which **month the expense belongs to**
* Generate accurate maintenance bills and reports without using accrual accounting

---

### **Reason for Change**

☑ User feedback
☑ Business requirement change
☑ Data integrity issue

Small housing societies (<50 flats) need a simple way to correctly allocate expenses without complex accounting.

---

### **Urgency Level**

**High** — Incorrect month allocation directly impacts billing, collections, and audit.

**Business Metrics Affected**

* Revenue impact: Reduced billing disputes, better collections
* Cost impact: Minimal development cost
* Productivity impact: Faster billing and reconciliation

---

### **2.2 Technical Impact**

* Output: Expense recorded with both payment date and expense month
* Used by: Billing engine, P&L, monthly reports

**FC-2: Monthly Bill Generation**

* Input: Selected billing month

* Output: Accurate maintenance bills

---

### **3.2 Non-Functional Changes**

**Usability**

---

## **5. TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

### **5.1 Test Strategy**

**Unit Testing**

* Validate expense_month is mandatory
