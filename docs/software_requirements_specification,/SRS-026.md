## ADDENDUM to Move-In / Move-Out CR & SRS ##


🔷 New Concept: Personal Arrears Account

When an owner or tenant vacates with unpaid dues:

Outstanding dues must be transferred from the Flat Ledger to a Personal Arrears Ledger belonging to that person.

This allows:

Flat transfer to proceed

Society’s claim to remain enforceable

🔁 Move-Out With Dispute – Revised Rule

Old rule:

Flat cannot be transferred if dues exist

New rule:

Flat may be transferred only after disputed dues are moved to Personal Arrears Ledger

🧾 Accounting Entry (Mandatory)

If Flat A-203 has ₹18,750 due and Owner Ramesh is vacating:

Ramesh_Arrears   Dr   18,750
    Flat A-203          18,750


Now:

Flat A-203 balance = 0
Ramesh Arrears = 18,750


Flat can be transferred.

🧾 Waiver or Settlement Later

If ₹5,000 waived:

Bad Debt / Waiver Dr 5,000
    Ramesh_Arrears     5,000


If ₹13,750 paid:

Bank Dr 13,750
    Ramesh_Arrears 13,750

🖥 Disputed Dues UI
Admin → Move-Out Screen
Flat A-203
Outgoing: Ramesh Kumar
Outstanding: ₹18,750 ⚠

[ Transfer to Personal Arrears ]
[ Block Transfer ]


Click → Transfer

Admin → Arrears Dashboard
PERSONAL ARREARS

Ramesh Kumar   ₹18,750
Suresh (Tenant) ₹6,200


Tap → View ledger

🔁 Settlement Workflow
Step 1 — Create Arrears
Move-Out → Transfer to Arrears

Step 2 — Negotiation

Committee decides:

Waive

Collect

Part settle

Step 3 — Apply Settlement

Buttons:

[ Receive Payment ]
[ Waive Amount ]
[ Close Arrears ]


Each generates proper voucher:

Receipt Voucher

Journal Voucher

🧾 Legal Status

GharMitra must label:

Arrears Status:
OPEN / PARTIALLY SETTLED / CLOSED


This gives legal trail.
